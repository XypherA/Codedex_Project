üåÄ While Loop Practice
Countdown:
Use a while loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1.

Sum of numbers:
Use a while loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 and print the result.

Even numbers only:
Use a while loop to print only even numbers from 2 to 20.

Guess the number:
Use a while loop that keeps asking the user to guess a secret number (use prompt() for browser) until they guess it correctly.

Binary conversion:
Use a while loop to convert a given number (e.g., 23) into binary (like the question we discussed earlier).

üîÅ For Loop Practice
Multiplication table:
Use a for loop to print the multiplication table for 7 (from 7 x 1 to 7 x 10).

Sum of squares:
Use a for loop to calculate the sum of the squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

Reverse countdown:
Use a for loop to print numbers from 50 down to 0, stepping by 5.

Factorial calculation:
Use a for loop to calculate the factorial of a given number (e.g., 5! = 5√ó4√ó3√ó2√ó1).

FizzBuzz:
Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 20, but:

If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"

If divisible by 5, print "Buzz"

If divisible by both, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
