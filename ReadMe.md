# 🐱 Codedex Projects

This repository contains all of my **Codedex projects** — small apps and exercises I’ve built while learning web development.  
It’s meant to track my progress, practice coding, and showcase what I’ve learned.

---

## 📂 Projects Included
- 🌤️ **Weather App** — Fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeather API. 
    Link to my Weather App - https://xyphera.github.io/Codedex_Project/weather-app/
- ...and more as I continue my learning journey.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XypherA/Codedex_Project.git
Open the project folder you want to try:

bash
Copy code
cd codedex-projects/weather-app
Open the index.html file in your browser.

🔑 Notes
Some projects (like the Weather App) use an API key.
For safety, the real key is not included. Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE in the code with your own key.

📖 About Codedex
Codedex is an interactive platform where I’m learning coding through projects, quests, and challenges.

✨ Future Plans
Add more projects as I progress.

Polish existing projects with better UI and features.

Turn this into a coding portfolio.
